### Houx : The Transparent Web Framework for Perfectionists 

Welcome to Houx.js, the modern sleek and robust web framework that empowers creative and productive development while Building web apps.

### Overview

**Houx** pronounced as (`horse`), a french word for `holly` which stands for `an evergreen shrub/tree` is a sophisticated modern and lightweight JavaScript framework inspired by the Vue.js options API, designed to streamline the development of dynamic, reactive, and component-based web applications.  
With its intuitive API and elegant architecture, Houx empowers developers to build complex UIs with simplicity and ease.  
Houx as a robust and revolutionary JavaScript framework that's changing the way we build web applications takes the best of modern web development and combines it with innovative features and a simplified architecture.


**Some Key Features and Capabilities:**

- **Component-driven architecture**: Build reusable and modular components with ease.
- **Declarative templating**: Write clean and concise templates with Houx intuitive syntax.
- **Two-way data binding**: Keep your data in sync with automatic updates.
- **Powerful state management**: Manage your application's state with ease.
- **Extensive ecosystem**: Leverage a growing community of developers and a wealth of plugins and tools.
- **Easy to learn**: Houx has a gentle learning curve, making it perfect for developers of all skill levels.
- **High-performance**: Houx is optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring fast and seamless user experiences.
- **Flexible and adaptable**: Houx is designed to fit your needs, not the other way around.
- **Virtual DOM**: Optimize performance with a virtual DOM that minimizes DOM mutations.
- **Smart Updates**: Update components only when necessary, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Context API**: Share data and functionality between widgets with a simple and efficient API.
- **Community-driven**: Join a growing community of developers and contributors.
- **Flexible Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other libraries , frameworks and existing projects, or use it standalone for new projects.
- **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom behaviorial attributes.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Execute code at specific points in a component's and element's lifecycle.

**Building web applications has never been easier**

 With a strong focus on maintainability, modularity, reusability, and simplicity, Houx makes it easy to build complex web applications without sacrificing performance.


**Rich Ecosystem**

Houx has a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries that help you build and maintain your application with ease. From a powerful templating engine to a robust routing system, Houx provides everything you need to build fast, efficient, and scalable web applications.

**Convention over Configuration**

Houx follows the convention over configuration approach, which means you can focus on building your application without worrying about the underlying plumbing.


**Just the UI**

Houx is only concerned with the view layer. It doesn't dictate how you manage your state or handle backend logic. This makes it easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux or GraphQL.

**Virtual DOM**

Houx is optimized for performance and scalability, with a virtual DOM that minimizes DOM mutations and smart updates that only update components when necessary. This means your application will be fast and responsive, even with complex and dynamic user interfaces.


**TypeScript Support**

An exclusive support for typescript which optimizes development bugs and runtime debuging.

**Getting Started**
You can install the houxkit:

```bash
npm install init:houx
```
This will scaffold a build system.  
You can use the houx without a houx:kit scaffolding
Or include it directly in your HTML file using a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/houx.js"></script>
```
check the Installation guide for detailed Installation information.

##### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Houx.js Example</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.example.com/houx.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  </div>

  <script>
    Houx.initBuild({
      model:function(){
        this.message= 'Hello, Houx.js!'
      }
    }).mount('#app');
    //houx will have to call the .mount(selector or DOM node) to get rendered to the DOM
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This example demonstrates how to create a basic Houx.js instance and bind data to the DOM.

##### Widgets

Widgets are reusable pieces of your UI. Define an initial entrypoint widget build by calling the `Houx.initBuild()` method: and then registering them with the initBuild.widget call.

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  model:function(){
    this.message= 'Hello, Houx.js!'
  }
}).widget('my-widget', {
  template: '<div>A custom widget!</div>'
}).mount('#app');
```

Use your widget in the DOM within the mount root:

```html
<my-widget></my-widget>
```

##### Reactivity System

Houx.js uses a reactive data system to update the DOM when your data changes. When you modify the data, the framework automatically re-renders the affected parts of the UI.

##### Directives

Directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element. Common directives include:

- `$$bind`: Bind a value to an element's attribute.
- `$$on`: Attach an event listener to an element.

Example:

```html
<button $$on:click="increment">Click me</button>
```

## Event Handling

Houx.js makes it easy to handle user events. Define methods in your widget and use the `$$on` directive:

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  data: {
    count: 0
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++;
    }
  }
}).mount('#app);
```

##### Data Binding

Houx.js supports both one-way and two-way data binding. Use the `$$model` directive for two-way data binding with form elements:

```html
<input $$model="message">
```

## Lifecycle Hooks

Houx.js provides several lifecycle hooks that allow you to run code at specific stages of a widget's life:

- `postBuild`: Called after the instance is created.
- `postMount`: Called after the instance is mounted.
- `postUpdate`: Called after the instance's data is updated.
- `postDestroy`: Called after the instance is destroyed.

Example:

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  model:function() {
    this.message= 'Hello!'
  },
  postBuild() {
    console.log('Instance created!');
  }
});
```

#### Advanced Topics

##### Custom Directives

You can create custom directives to encapsulate reusable behavior:

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  //widget options
}).directive('focus', {
  created(el) {
    el.$element.focus();
  }
});
```

##### Plugins

Extend Houx.js functionality with plugins. A plugin is a function that adds global functionality:

```javascript

Houx.initBuild({
  //options
}).install({
  plugin:function(build, options){
    
  }
}, {
  //plugin options
});
```
